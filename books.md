By some miracle, back in Dec 2020, I got myself to start reading books, for the first time in probably 10 or 12 years. Even more incredible is I started waking up early in the morning to do it.

In order to force myself to continue this habit, I'm making this a public page on my blog. With a full year calendar to indicate the days I've read. Kinda like the ["Every Day Calendar" by Simone Giertz](https://www.simonegiertz.com/every-day-calendar)...but I can't afford one, and this site is free.

## Current book:

* [*Chronicles of a Motorcycle Gypsy: The 49 States Tour* by Tiffani Burkett](https://amzn.to/3nQdddB)
  * A friend of mine wrote this book, I bought it almost immediately, but I just haven't had time to read it. It's about her incredible journey around the entire Continental United States while living on the back of her motorcycle, camping wherever she can and running into all sorts of surprises good and bad.

## Recently finished books:

### January:

* [*Microsoft SQL Server 2012 T-SQL Fundamentals* by Itzik Ben-Gan](https://amzn.to/3svr2BU)
  * I can't believe I had this goldmine sitting on my bookshelf for nearly 8 years. I wish I had read this when I bought it. This is an incredible book...not only is it great for those looking to learn T-SQL, but even as a database developer with nearly a decade of experience...I learned a TON from this book, and I may even need to read it again, though I'm hoping a new edition will be coming out since the latest edition (3rd) was released in 2016.
* [*Microsoft SQL Server 2012 High-Performance T-SQL Using Window Functions* by Itzik Ben-Gan](https://amzn.to/3inZ2vd)
  * This one is also a goldmine for those who are a little more advanced. There's a ton of great information in here...but don't expect to understand it all on  your first read. Even if you *think* you know windowing functions well...once you read this,  you'll realize you were very **very** wrong.
* [*Exam Ref 70-762 Developing SQL Databases* by Louis Davidson](https://amzn.to/35Re73h)
  * Read in order to prepare for the 70-762 exam. Great book for learning high level concepts for just about everything to do with SQL Server (minus any DML). It was just enough information for me to pass my exam. Unfortunately, the book has a ton of spelling/grammar mistakes (seemed like 1 error per page on average). Many times it was hard to read because the mistakes were very distracting and interrupted the flow of reading. But if you can look past that, this is still a decent book for getting a nice high-level view (even despite the test being retired now, it may still be a good starting point).

### February:

* [*What Every BODY is Saying* by Joe Navarro](https://amzn.to/3oQtvVh)
  * Body Language...how to read it. I originally read this book back in high school; It ended up being a huge impact on my life. It's helped me perform better in interviews by reading their body language, and also making sure I project the right body language to them. I highly recommend this book. On top of learning how to read body language, the book is chock-full of insane stories from a former FBI counterintelligence officer and their experiences using these skills.

## Todo List:

* [*T-SQL Querying* by Itzik Ben-Gan, Adam Machanic, Dejan Sarka, Kevin Farlee](https://amzn.to/39BLMzk)
  * From what I can tell, it's basically an extended version of T-SQL Fundamentals, which was already an incredible book. Can't wait to get to this one.
* [*T-SQL Window Functions: For data analysis and beyond* by Itzik Ben-Gan](https://amzn.to/3sxF7yv)
  * I read the first edition of this book, but since then, it is 100 pages longer, and has an extra chapter, so would be good to re-read this to fill the gaps from the previous edition
* [*Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions* by Brian Christian, Tom Griffiths](https://amzn.to/3ijrSgk)
  * I've actually already "read" this via audio book, but I think it would be better as an actual physical book
* [*Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software* by Charles Petzold](https://amzn.to/39y9OLu)
  * This is probably one of my all time favorite books. I've read it at least twice, but it's been about 12 years since I last read it, so I think it's time to go through it again.
* [*The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey To Mastery, 20th Anniversary Edition (2nd Edition)* by David Thomas, Andrew Hunt](https://amzn.to/3oRAm0K)
  * I recently listened to this as an audio book, and it's definitely a good listen. But there were many parts with code examples where physically reading it would be helpful. So I hope to read this someday soon.
* [*C# 8.0 in a Nutshell: The Definitive Reference* by Joseph Albahari, Eric Johannsen](https://amzn.to/2KlumOF)
  * Bought this book a while back and got about 100 pages in and then broke my reading habit. It's a pretty big book, and dense with information...but hoping to get through this one to improve my C# skills one of these days.

## 2021

X = minimum 1 hour of reading

If I didn't read that day, I'll try to list a 1 word reason as to why I skipped that day. But if the day is blank...that means I was lazy and didn't do something productive that day.

* "Blog" - chose to work on or write a blog instead of reading
* "Class" - attended an online training class
* "Study" - chose to study for some sort of certification exam
* "Exam" - took a certification exam, so the day was spent prepping

By some miracle, back in Dec 2020, I got myself to start reading books, for the first time in probably 10 or 12 years. Even more incredible is I started waking up early in the morning to do it.

In order to force myself to continue this habit, I'm making this a public page on my blog. With a full year calendar to indicate the days I've read. Kinda like the ["Every Day Calendar" by Simone Giertz](https://www.simonegiertz.com/every-day-calendar)...but I can't afford one, and this site is free.

## Current book(s):

I generally try to only read one book at a time, but sometimes there are exceptions. Right now I'm reading two books because I'm trying to cram for my upcoming 70-762 exam. But once I finish taking that exam, I'll be switching back to reading one book at a time.

* [Exam Ref 70-762 Developing SQL Databases](https://amzn.to/35Re73h)
  * Currently preparing to take my 70-762 exam on Jan 29th. I just bought this book, and hoping to plow through it in 10 days ðŸ˜­ I doubt I'll make it through cover to cover...but, I should be able to cover the sections I'm not familiar with. ðŸ¤ž

* [*What Every BODY is Saying* by Joe Navarro](https://amzn.to/3oQtvVh)
  * Body Language...how to read it. I originally read this book back in high school; It ended up being a huge impact on my life. It's helped me perform better in interviews by reading their body language, and also making sure I project the right body language to them. I highly recommend this book. On top of learning how to read body language, the book is chock-full of insane stories from a former FBI counterintelligence officer and their experiences using these skills.

## Recently finished books:

### January:

* [*Microsoft SQL Server 2012 T-SQL Fundamentals* by Itzik Ben-Gan](https://amzn.to/3svr2BU)
  * I can't believe I had this goldmine sitting on my bookshelf for nearly 8 years. I wish I had read this when I bought it. This is an incredible book...not only is it great for those looking to learn T-SQL, but even as a database developer with nearly a decade of experience...I learned a TON from this book, and I may even need to read it again, though I'm hoping a new edition will be coming out since the latest edition (3rd) was released in 2016.
* [*Microsoft SQL Server 2012 High-Performance T-SQL Using Window Functions* by Itzik Ben-Gan](https://amzn.to/3inZ2vd)
  * This one is also a goldmine for those who are a little more advanced. There's a ton of great information in here...but don't expect to understand it all on  your first read. Even if you *think* you know windowing functions well...once you read this,  you'll realize you were very **very** wrong.

## Todo List:

* [*T-SQL Querying* by Itzik Ben-Gan, Adam Machanic, Dejan Sarka, Kevin Farlee](https://amzn.to/39BLMzk)
  * From what I can tell, it's basically an extended version of T-SQL Fundamentals, which was already an incredible book. Can't wait to get to this one.
* [*T-SQL Window Functions: For data analysis and beyond* by Itzik Ben-Gan](https://amzn.to/3sxF7yv)
  * I read the first edition of this book, but since then, it is 100 pages longer, and has an extra chapter, so would be good to re-read this to fill the gaps from the previous edition
* [*Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions* by Brian Christian, Tom Griffiths](https://amzn.to/3ijrSgk)
  * I've actually already "read" this via audio book, but I think it would be better as an actual physical book
* [*Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software* by Charles Petzold](https://amzn.to/39y9OLu)
  * This is probably one of my all time favorite books. I've read it at least twice, but it's been about 12 years since I last read it, so I think it's time to go through it again.
* [*The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey To Mastery, 20th Anniversary Edition (2nd Edition)* by David Thomas, Andrew Hunt](https://amzn.to/3oRAm0K)
  * I recently listened to this as an audio book, and it's definitely a good listen. But there were many parts with code examples where physically reading it would be helpful. So I hope to read this someday soon.
* [*Chronicles of a Motorcycle Gypsy: The 49 States Tour* by Tiffani Burkett](https://amzn.to/3nQdddB)
  * A friend of mine wrote this book, I bought it almost immediately, but I just haven't had time to read it. But it's definitely at the top of the list of books I am hoping to read soon.
* [*C# 8.0 in a Nutshell: The Definitive Reference* by Joseph Albahari, Eric Johannsen](https://amzn.to/2KlumOF)
  * Bought this book a while back and got about 100 pages in and then broke my reading habit. It's a pretty big book, and dense with information...but hoping to get through this one to improve my C# skills one of these days.

## 2021

X = minimum 1 hour of reading

If I didn't read that day, I'll try to list a 1 word reason as to why I skipped that day. But if the day is blank...that means I was lazy and broke the streak.

* "Blog" - chose to work on or write a blog instead of reading
* "Class" - attended an online training class
* "Study" - chose to study for some sort of certification exam
* "Exam" - took a certification exam, so the day was spent prepping

Hi! Glad to see you found my site.

I'm your average everyday nerd, developer, motorcycle enthusiast, dog dad.

Throughout the day, I tend to research deeply into the things that I'm working on. Rather than letting all that work go to waste, it seemed like a good idea to document what I learn in the form of blog posts and public notes.

That's going to mean a wide variety of topics... SQL/T-SQL, PowerShell, C#, tool recomendations and reviews, various How-To's, cheatsheets, nerdy home projects...maybe even some less technical topics, like my hobbies; Motorcycles, Rubik's cubes, tools, archery, dogs, the list goes on.

Hope you enjoy what you're reading here!

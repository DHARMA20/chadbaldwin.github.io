Hi! Glad to see you found my site.

I'm your average everyday nerd, developer, motorcycle enthusiast, dog dad.

Throughout the day, I tend to research deeply into the things that I'm working on. Rather than letting all that work go to waste, it seemed like a good idea to document what I learn in the form of blog posts and public notes.

That's going to mean a wide variety of topics... SQL/T-SQL, PowerShell, C#, tool recomendations and reviews, various How-To's, cheatsheets, nerdy home projects...maybe even some less technical topics, like my hobbies; Motorcycles, Rubik's cubes, tools, archery, dogs, the list goes on.

If you like what you're reading, or you have recommendations, feel free to email me. If you want to subscribe, you can use the RSS feed, or I suppose you can watch for changes on this websites GitHub repo... though that will probably be pretty noisy :)

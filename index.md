# Welcome to my blog

Hi! Glad to see you found my site.

I'm your average, everyday nerd, developer, motorcycle enthusiast, dog dad.

I created this site because throughout the day, I tend to deeply research into various topics that I'm working on. Rather than letting all that work go to waste, it seemed like a good idea to document what I learned in the form of blog posts and maintained notes.

That's going to mean a wide variety of topics...SQL/T-SQL, PowerShell, C#, tool recomendations and reviews, various How-To's, cheatsheets, nerdy home projects...maybe even some less technical stuff, like my hobbies; Things like, motorcycles, Rubik's cubes, tools, archery, dogs, etc.

If you like what you're reading, or you have some recommendations, feel free to email me at the address at the bottom of the page. If youw want to subscribe, you can use the RSS feed, or I suppose you can watch for changes on the websites GitHub repo...though that will probably be pretty noisy :)
